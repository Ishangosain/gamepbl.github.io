            <p><font size="5"> Network graph is simply called as graph. It consists of a set of nodes connected 
                 by branches. In graphs, a node is a common point of two or more branches.
                 Sometimes, only a single branch may connect to the node. A branch is a line segment that 
                 connects two nodes. Any electric circuit or network can be converted into its equivalent graph
                  by replacing the passive elements and voltage sources with short circuits and the current 
                  sources with open circuits. That means, the line segments in the graph represent the branches 
                  corresponding to either passive elements or voltage sources of electric circuit.</font> </p>

                                                                                   b)Unconnected Graph:-If there exists at least one node in the graph that remains unconnected by even 
                                                                                   single branch, then it is called as an unconnected graph</p>
                                                                                   c)Directed Graph:-If all the branches of a graph are represented with arrows, then that graph is called as a
                                                                                    directed graph. These arrows indicate the direction of current flow in each branch. 
                                                                                    Hence, this graph is also called as oriented graph.</p>
                                                                                   d)Undirected Graph:-If the branches of a graph are not represented with arrows, then that graph is called as an undirected graph.
                                                                                    Since, there are no directions of current flow, this graph is also called as an unoriented graph.</p>
                                                                                   <p>2.Subgraphs:-A part of the graph is called as a subgraph. We get subgraphs by removing some nodes and/or
                                                                                        branches of a given graph. So, the number of branches and/or nodes of a subgraph will be less than that of
                                                                                         the original graph. Hence, we can conclude that a subgraph is a subset of a graph.</p>

                                                 that subgraph. The branches of a tree are called as twigs.</p>
                                                 2.b)Co-Tree:- It is a subgraph, which is formed with the branches that are removed while forming a Tree. Hence, it is called as Complement of a Tree.
                                                  and its branches are called as links or chords. In general, the links are represented with dotted lines.
